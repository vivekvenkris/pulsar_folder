Skeleton docker file with necessary software to fold pulsar data


# known bug

If you cannot run psrchive on psrfits format data, please do the following:
```
export PSRCHIVE=/software//psrchive/install/
export PSRFITSDEFN=/software//psrchive/install/share/psrheader.fits
```
This will be fixed in a future version.
